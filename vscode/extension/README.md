# Welcome to Acorn!

This extension is all you need to use the Acorn theorem prover. It includes both a verifier for the Acorn language, and an AI assistant that can fill in the details of your proofs.

To get started, just open a new Acorn file, with a `.ac` suffix. Like `hello.ac`, that's a good name for an Acorn file.

The assistant will open automatically. If you close the assistant, you can open it again by clicking the little acorn icon in the upper right, when you have an Acorn file open.

## Documentation

It would be nice if I linked to the documentation right here!
